This is my personal [NixOS][1] + [Home Manager][2] configuration redesigned and
rewritten from scratch using everything I learned from all the other times I
rewrote my configs and everything I saw in other NixOS dotfile repos.

I'm not arrogant enough to claim that I found the best design pattern to or
anything like that but I am pretty happy with the structure and all.

I'm making use of the Dendritic Nix design pattern which is very interesting and
makes organization and modularization far more simpler and straightforward
making the entire project structure far cleaner overall.
